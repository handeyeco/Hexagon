# Hexagon

A digital art project built with the Web Audio API and the Canvas API. Use your keyboard or mouse to make sounds. Control the volume with the `+` or `-` buttons.

Sounds are completely generated in the browser (it isn't playing pre-recorded samples, but is synthesized).

Uses [Simple Reverb](https://github.com/web-audio-components/simple-reverb), a [gist](https://gist.github.com/callumlocke/cc258a193839691f60dd) to scale according to device pixel ratio, and some math to create a hexagon that I found in a gist that I then lost.
